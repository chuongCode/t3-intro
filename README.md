# Emoji social media platform

This is a fun little application akin to Twitter where emojis are the only way to communicate your thoughts for the hour! It's currently hosted on https://t3-intro-beta.vercel.app/

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` and was meant to familiarize me with the T3 stack and its capabilities.

Following in the footsteps of the great Theo Browne of [t3.gg](https://t3.gg/)

This project is built using Typescript, structured around tRPC for type safety, with Next.js and React for frontend, Tailwind for styling, Prisma for database, Vercel for deployment, Planetscale for DB management, Hot-toast for notifications, Zod for validation, Upstash for rate-limiting, Axciom for sign-in functionality, and Dayjs for handling relative time.
